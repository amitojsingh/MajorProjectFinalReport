\vskip 0.1in Automated Building Drawing is a project for creating two-dimensional drawings. The main purpose or objective of the project is to make it usable even by the layman. The main target users are the Civil Engineers who want
their plans to be printed on the sheets. The interface should be easy to use and pretty intuitive. Because the interface
is a thing that makes user experience better and to make the user use it.\\

\noindent Automated Building Drawings was made keeping in mind the various facts like people who spend several man hours, which often run into days, making the drawings using old traditions by the use of pencil and paper. This project will not only help them significantly reduce the time consumed in making the drawings, but will also make the overall process very simple and easy to use.\\

\noindent Also, this project is completely open source and is made using C++, libdxf, LibreCAD, and Qt and the entire code is available to the user as and when required. There is also a Complete Documentation as well as User manual along with it for making the developing and using the software a lot easier.
