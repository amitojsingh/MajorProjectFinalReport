\noindent Automated Building Drawings System is used to eliminate the previous manual process of creation of drawings using the traditional techniques by replacing it with the automated system, such that the end user can now easily make the required drawing design 
and the whole process can be made more easy and reliable for the users thus saving time. All the drawings can also be exported in some supported file format using this software thus making the system more useful and reliable.\\

\noindent User can easily maintain all the record of the previously created drawing designs by saving them into the computer memory. It eliminates the manual operations and thus
increases productivity in the system by automating it. Entities can be crated just by giving their names and parameters thus the whole process becomes a very fast. The Drawing can be easily generated for a particular building by giving all the specifications such as length of the walls, height, width etc thus managing the system overall. \\

\noindent Firstly the user input the required specifications of the desired design such as length, height, the type of entity etc. Then these parameters and all other details are saved in a input file which is a txt file. Then this file is parsed into the system where the processing is done and the input file is splitted into the output file where its parameters are separated into the lines. \\

\noindent This file then parsed into the system from which the system reads the content that is specified by the user and then according to that information the Automated Building Drawings system produces a drawing which can be opened using the cad software LibreCad.\\

\noindent The traditional pencil and paper work can be reduced to a great extent by doing work using this software and saving paper thus
making it environment friendly. Thus, making it automated process. Lot of time was wasted during the drawing of buildings using the pencil and paper. So with this software even the  people who is not proficient in computer can easily take the benefit of cration of drawings using this software
